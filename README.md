# CellService

CellService is an open-source software for analysis of microscopy images.
The aim of the project is to provide physicians, biologists, and biotechnologists with an easy tool for investigating their own images of biological samples.
CellService IS NOT developed for clinical purposes, but only for the research field.

CellService is written in Python and tested on Windows and GNU/Linux.
